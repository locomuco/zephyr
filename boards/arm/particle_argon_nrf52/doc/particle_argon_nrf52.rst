####################

Overview
********

`particle argon`_ is a WiFi mesh gateway HW platform containing
a nRF52840 for mesh support and a ESP32 to provide WiFi.
The board was developed by Particle Industries and has a SWD connector 
on it to be programmable.

It is equipped with a onboard LIPO circuit and conforms with the
Adafruit Feather formfactor.

Zephyr applications use the particle argon board configuration
to run on the particle argon board hardware. It provides
support for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 ARM |reg| Cortex |reg|-M4F SoC
with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth |reg| Low Energy
and IEEE |reg| 802.15.4.

The schematic can be found on the `particle argon website`_.

Hardware
********

On the front of the board are RGB-LED, LED and LIPO circuitru.
The RGB-LED is controlled by the nRF52840 via GPIO pins.

Power supply
============

The board is optimized for low power applications and supports two
power source configurations, battery and micro USB connector.

It contains circuitry for LIPO usage and can be charged via the USB port.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``particle_argon_nrf52`` board configuration can be
built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Build and flash an application in the usual way, for example:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: particle_argon_nrf52
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: particle_argon_nrf52
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug


Testing the LEDs and buttons
****************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and
LEDs on the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :ref:`blinky-sample`
* :ref:`button-sample`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board.
